# Horiseon Marketing Refractory  

The aim of this project was to refine the website mock up given to us. The code in question had a number of issues that made it less accessible to those differently abled as well as some functionality issues. To that end changes to the semantic HTML elements and CSS were made to correct these problems. These changes are as follows: 

## Corrective Actions Taken

```
- ID tags were added to correct issues with Navigation bar functionality.
- multiple Div tags were altered and comments were included to increase readibility of source code.
- CSS elements were consolidated so as to prevent redundancies in code.
- Alt tags were add to increase accessibily and search engine optimization.
- Digital Marketing Image was removed from CSS and relocated to index so alt tag could be applied.
```
